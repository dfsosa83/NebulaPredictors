## Description
NebulaPredictors is a project focused on predicting pips in the euro/dolar (EUR/USD) pair to assist a trading bot in making real-world trading decisions. The project explores various predictive models and techniques to forecast the movement of the EUR/USD pair.

## Goals
- Develop accurate and reliable predictive models for forex pips using machine learning and statistical analysis.
- Train a trading bot to utilize the predictions for informed decision-making in real-time trading scenarios.
- Continuously analyze and improve the models to enhance performance and predictive capabilities.

## Folder Structure
<<<<<<< HEAD
- `models`: Contains the machine learning models utilized for prediction of every trial.
- `notebooks`: Contains Jupyter notebooks used for data exploration, model training, evaluation, and experimentation in every trial. Aditionally contain .py files with 
               flask.
=======
- `trained_models`: Contains the machine learning models utilized for prediction.
- `notebooks`: Contains Jupyter notebooks used for data exploration, model training, evaluation, and experimentation.

- `enviroment.yml`: File specifying the Anaconda environment dependencies required for the project.

## Usage
- Clone this repository to your local machine.
- Set up the required environment using the specifications in `enviroment.yml`.
- Explore the notebooks in the `notebooks` directory for data analysis, model training, and evaluation.
